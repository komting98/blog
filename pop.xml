Accidental domestication, a solid-state electric airplane, the science of gender identity, InSight lands on Mars, bat and dolphin sonar crosstalk and how birds find seeds.
</title>
<description>
Captive rearing can accidentally change animals so they may not survive in the wild; A new plane with no moving parts flies by electrifying the air; Scientist refutes notion that gender identity is an 'unscientific liberal ideology'; Mars-quakes may shake the red planet, and NASA's new lander will detect them; How bats and dolphins use their sonar when everyone's talking at once; How do birds find seeds?

Greenland asteroid impact, short people in the rainforest, reef islands and sea level, stealth moths, walking on water and climbing the walls and is the night sky changing?
</title>
<description>
An asteroid impact on Greenland left a massive crater under the ice; Will coral reef islands rise or fall? It's a greenhouse-gas paradox; How moths evolved a kind of stealth jet technology to sneak past bats; Tiny people have evolved in rainforests because it's where tiny steps are better; The mysteries of animal movement - how they walk on water and climb up walls; What are the visible changes in the night sky in the last 3,000 years?

Bitcoin's energy costs, beatboxers invent new sounds, wind farms change lizards, chucking salmon for science, piranha barking, smells and mapping, and heat and humidity.
</title>
<description>
Bitcoin mining uses more energy than mining for real gold; Beatboxers have invented whole new ways of making sounds; Wind farms in India are driving a population boom of skinny, fearless lizards; For 20 years, scientists have been chucking fish into the forest. Here's why; Barking piranhas and screeching catfish are the sounds of the Amazon River; Sniffing your way around - our brains are built to navigate by scent; Why does humidity make us feel hotter in the summer and colder in winter?

Politics puts the Amazon at risk, the problem with probiotics, biggest bird was blind, transforming robots, the origins of chocolate and why fish aren't salty.
</title>
<description>
The 'Trump of the Tropics' is now in charge of the lungs of the planet. Here's why that's scary; Probiotics probably aren't making you well, and they could make you sicker; The biggest bird in history might have been blind as a bat; A step towards Optimus Prime - transforming robots can reshape themselves; Aged chocolate: Archeologists find evidence of 5000 year old chocolate drink; Why are salt water fish not salty to eat?

Neanderthal nursing, Antarctica's singing snows, Fish and hook injuries and more, Our purple planet, Evolution goes to town and why two ears don't hear louder than one.
</title>
<description>
Neanderthals nursed their sick and injured back to health with ancient medicine; Listen to the Antarctic ice sheet sing a song of melting ice; There's a catch to 'catch and release:' hook injuries interfere with fish feeding; Purple reign: life on Earth might once have been dominated by purple micro-organisms; Evolution is going uptown as plants and animals adapt to city life; Why is the sound we hear in two ear buds not twice as loud as the sound from one?

Beer shortages could be a consequence of climate change thanks to barley crop failures; A dung beetle's genital worms will help care for its offspring; A meat eater chooses a side of seagrass - this shark's an omnivore; Rain, spiders and bears are all part of discovering Canada's backcountry biology; Why you don't go momentarily blind when you blink; Why don't we sneeze when we're asleep?

Canada's newest Nobel laureate, reading surgeons' minds, sniffing out shark water, a moon in an alien solar system and women and autism underdiagnosis
</title>
<description>
Canada's latest Nobel winner is a 'laser jock' who loves the lab; Researchers are reading doctors' brains to see how good they are at surgery; 'Smelling' for shark DNA to see if it's safe to go back in the water; Watching a moon rise - in a solar system 8000 light years away; Thousands of women with autism may be going undiagnosed because it's a 'male disorder'.

What this man with narcolepsy can teach us about getting better sleep; Bird song is unique as well as beautiful - no other animal makes noise this way; 'Nuclear pasta' on a neutron star could support mountains centimetres tall; How manta rays eat could be the secret to filtering pollution from water; No more sunburns: a simple wristband helps us get just the right amount of sun; Why is bird poop white?

What to save? Making hard choices in the conservation of wild animals and wild spaces

How we make decisions about what to save, and do we explore the idea of "conservation triage." So do we choose pipelines or killer whales? And is this an argument about money - or about values that transcend it?

August 18, 2018: Canada bans neonics, tracking animals from space, elephant zombie gene, repelling elephants to save from poachers, and growing enough food.
</title>
<description>
Canada bans neonic pesticides implicated in bee declines; Tracking animals from space could provide early warning of natural disasters; Elephants have a zombie gene that comes back to life to fight cancer; How do you discourage a pesky elephant? Use bee smells as a repellent; We can't grow enough food to feed the world according to the Food Guide; Low level air pollution costs the economy billions of dollars in lost productivity; If the moon had oceans what would its tides be like?

August 11, 2018 - Climate change attribution for extreme weather, cockpit air quality, and more Also, predicting adult voices from baby cries, island bird brains bigger than mainland birds, and lobster pain
</title>
<description>
'Climate change is here' - but is it to blame for the extreme weather this summer? Why the airline industry might want to lower cockpit CO2 levels. A baby's cries can predict the sound of their adult voice. Island birds would likely beat their mainland relatives in a battle of wits. Do lobsters feel pain when we boil them? Why does eating beets make my urine turn pink?

August 4, 2018 - Parker Solar Probe to 'touch' the sun, child's brain rewires itself after chunk removed, gut microbes sabotaging weight loss, wolf spider's diet could help cool the Arctic, searching for star dust, and firefly glow
</title>
<description>
Sun probe set to embark on perilous journey into the 'heart of the fire.' Scientists get a rare glimpse of the brain reorganizing itself after a lobectomy. Darn gut bacteria might be thwarting your weight loss efforts. Arctic spiders spinning new food web as climate warms - and that's a good thing. Your rooftop could be sprinkled with cosmic star dust. Do fireflies glow just at night or do they glow during the day too?

July 28, 2018 - 'Shark Week' is bad for sharks, Milky Way music, climate change makes fish smell badly. Also, flying a drone by moving your body, rats are bad for coral reefs, hunting bison with fire, and sunscreen and freshwater lakes.
</title>
<description>
Scientists want a 'fin-ale' to Shark Week shows that hurt sharks. An astronomer turns the motions of our Milky Way galaxy into sweet music. Greenhouse gases will make fish smell worse as the oceans acidify. Piloting a drone with 'body english' beats joysticks hands down. Oh rats! Seabird-eating rodents are hurting coral reefs near tropical islands. Indigenous people hunted bison using fire - and clever manipulation of the landscape. Does sunscreen damage freshwater lake ecosystems?

July 21, 2018 - Bread came before agriculture, driving drowsiness, the science of 'Ant-Man,' geese race north, dolphins avoid the bends, Jupiter's new moons and a question of symmetry
</title>
<description>
A bread recipe from 14,000 years ago: wild oats, barley, wheat and roots. Your car might be trying to kill you by lulling you with sleep-inducing vibrations. The science behind 'Ant-man' - Did they really just put 'quantum' in front of everything? Migrating geese are losing the race north - and their chicks are paying the price. Diving a kilometre down and not getting 'the bends' - how dolphins do it. New moons of Jupiter came from a demolition derby, and it's not over yet. The reason why most animals are symmetrical has to do with their locomotion
